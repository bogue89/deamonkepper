Demon Keeper
------------

Demon keeper is a great way to start, stop, and check process form a web project.

It keeps track of a running script locking his process id into a visible file as well of logging the action in the .log file.

You can start a process and let it running asynchronous keeping track of that Demon through the log file or the `status` function. Or set the option `background` to false to run it synchronous and wait for the output.


Look how easy it is to use:

    <?php
    /* Run a Demon */
    
    require('./Source/DemonKeeper.php');

	use DemonKeeper\DemonKeeper;

    try {
		$script = new DemonKeeper('./Demo/Demon.php');
		
		if($script->isAlive()) {
			$script->stop();
		} else {
			$script->start();
		}
	} catch(DemonKeeperException $e) {
		print_r($e);
	} catch(Exception $e) {
		print_r($e);
	}
